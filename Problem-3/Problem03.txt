Given an read-only array of size n, find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times. For example, if the input arrays is {3, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3} and k is 4, then the output should be [2, 3]. Note that size of array is 8 (or n = 8), so we need to find all elements that appear more than 2 (or 8/4) times. There are two elements that appear more than two times, 2 and 3

Constraints:-

1) you can not perform sorting of array
2) you can not use nesting of loop
3) value of k must be 2<= K < n
4) you can not use build-in function in python for count
